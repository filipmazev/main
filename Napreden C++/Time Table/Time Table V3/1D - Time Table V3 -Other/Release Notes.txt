CALCULATOR + / TIME TABLE V3 (beta 7) 

source code - original Time Table(Code Block w/ C++  and gmp library) - 942 lines of code (+89 lines of text for tutorial) 
gui code - source code + Qt GUI(Qt w/ C++, gmp and  Qt library) - 1555 lines of code (mostly source code(doesnt include data calculator or extra options)



NEW FEATURES :

-added history option, the abbility to save the last result and display it whenever you wish, this feature is present, the
convert options are remembered, including the time prefix, also the previously entered values are remembered together with 
the last result from those values entered, they show as previously entered when starting the app and as entered when entering new values, 
these features are available only in the graphics user interface version of the Time Table and/or Calculator Plus app.

-added date formats and the ability to change them. The order of what you enter first adapts to the selected date format

-addded GUI for the time calculator with keyboard and mouse button clicks

-added tips and information for Time Table GUI, one for the new conversion mode
and one that activates by pressig 'I' that gives out keybinds and tips

-added conversion mode switch in the GUI version of the program

-added the ability to convert days/hours/min/sec/milsec/micsec/nansec to days : hours : minutes : seconds : milliseconds : microseconds, nanoseconds

-added direct conversion of minutes, hours, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds and days

-added modes, the ability to turn them off and on or change them, included with them is a
do not disturb mode where it doesnt ask you for a mode every time, it remembers the previous mode used

-added advanced mode - gives out fixed numbers, removes the (beta), gives out milliseconds as direct and converted, 
shows converted numbers with decimals(not the direct coversion)

-added standard mode - gives out fixed numbers, ( example: e+004 to 13420000)

-added scientific mode - gives out scientific numbers, gives out microseconds and nanoseconds as direct and converted, adds precision of 50 numbers

-added options for standard and scientific view of the numbers, the option for automatic adjust
accoriding to the preset used, this output options are saved and remembered for next use 

-added decimal removal system, where the number entered = number entered - the int of the entered numer ( example: 54.2312 = 54.2312 - 54 = 0.2312 ), 
this allows the program to be able to convert numbers up to 40 digits(including the decimals)

-added year and leap year direct conversion, the option to disable this and an excplanation of how it works for the standard mode

-added dates option, a mode that gives out the amount of days for a given year and month and the day that the entered date is, was or will be

-added the ability to show what day a specific date was, works up to 2300s and as low as 1700s, for anything above or below
this years, the program will show the day that the entered month in the entered year started with, the only differance
beeing that above or bellow said numbers the program will not take into a count the entered days for this proccess.

-added time past since and time untill the date entered, standard converted and dynamic direct conversion depending on mode

-added restart, exit and back options



BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS : 

-fixed bug where the last remembered time prefix would randomly revert back to milliseconds when changing the prefix and saving again

-fixed bug where when clicking on a new time prefix and/or turning the convert option on/off the entered values would reset, now seamlessly
converts between any time value and converts directly or as a standard conversion.

-fixed bug where after continuing to type after getting a result the numbers typed would appear as a part of the result and not as a new number.

-fixed bug where after entering two numbers and an operation and not clicking on equal before clicking any of the time options, the program
would give out the result only for the second number, not the equivalent of the two numbers and the operation, now clicking
any of the time options first acts as a equal button if any operation is selected.

-fixed bug where the backspace key will delete everything, even if theres only a '0' as a result or entered, now
removes a digit until it gets to 1 digit, when theres only one digit, it converts it to 0, this also works
with decimal places, if theres a 0.0 it would delete digits untill it get to the 0, works with any number.

-fixed bug where after getting a result, clicking a number will reset it to 0, and the next entered number wont register

-fixed bug in GUI where it would delete the first entered instead of the last etered number when pressing backspace

-fixed bug where text would go over the borders of the app or would print the incorrect word, example for 1 day it would
print 1 days, or it would just print 0.  

-fixed bug where you would have to clear all, than choose a mode, then enter your desired value and then finnaly convert, the text would previously
go to 0 everytime you didnt do this in the same order, now you enter your desired value and choose what to convert it to (in GUI Time Table app).

-fixed bug where entering a options thats not on the screen would be accepted, now prompts to enter again

-fixed bug where entering the incorrect value ( ex. a char where a int should be), now prompts to enter again 

-fixed bug where every time the direct conversions would show without decimals or as a e+00x number, now shows the whole number as a <<fixed; 
in standard mode, and as a scientific or e+00x in advanced mode

-fixed bug where numbers would go bellow 0 (example: -21.324 seconds), added an algorithm to fix it, now calculates in long_double_t and long long int,
 allso uses the decimals instead of -=x and +=x2 ( example: 56.562m = 56min 0.562s * 60 = 33.72 -> 33s, 0.72 * 1000 = 720 milliseconds )

-fixed bug where x would show as x-1 59m 59s 999 mls, now shows correctly 
(example: entered-3m - output: 2min 59sec 999mls / entered-4h - output: 3h 59m 59s 999mls | now shows: 3min 0s 0 mls / 4h 0min 0s 0mls )

-fixed a bug where numbers would go bellow 0 after entering 20 digits and 20 decimals

-fixed a bug where everything lower than milliseconds would show incorrectly or wouldnt show at all 

-fixed contextual errors, added smart responses that take into a count what you have entered or what the result is

-fixed a bug where date would show up incorrectly when enterying the same year, same month but lower day, or bigger year, same month and smaller day
and every other simular variation of this, now shows the years and months correctly

-fixed major data calculator bugs when calculating time passed since today

-fixed incorrect time format, added a preview of what the current time format is for output

-fixed a bug where data calculator may show incorrect context when displaying the result, may show untill for past or since for future

-fixed bug with data calculator where it would output incorrect data when calculating for lower or higher dates

-general bug fixes and improvements to gui, improved look and functionality, more logical results and outputs from keypresses, improved button support, etc.

-repairs to the space-time continuum, etc.



KNOWN ISSUES :

-previously entered remembers the second number and any other numbers typed will apear as the very first number typed, the operation and then the new number typed

-pressing an operation after typing a second number will not give out the result of the numbers and the pressed operation

-data calculator will not show what day it was or will be for dates bigger than 2300 or lower than 1700

-time calculator may not function when going past 20 digtis and 20 decimals combined, or 40 digits, or 1 digit and 39 decimals



FUTURE FEATURES :

-menus will be added to the gui version of the program, this will include the extra options such as the modes, output options, back, exit and restart,
year conversion option and much more.

-date conversion and the date system will be added to the gui version of the program as a option in the new drop-down menu as a new calculator mode

-new calulators will be added such as a scientific, advanced, standard, programing, conversion( currency, 
weight and mass, volume, lenght, energy, speed, pressure, angel) calculators and much more
